# MJNotes
- **Code Challenge:** Build a basic note taking and storage app using a strict MVVMC architecture pattern. 

## Project Configuration
- **Compiler:** Xcode 11.6
- **Language:** Swift 5
- **Dependency Manager:** Carthage


## Instructions for running app
- **Execute in shell:**  "carthage update --platform ios" in project directory
- **Compile:** And run!

## Notes
- Used all allowed third-party frameworks with the exception of AlamoFire; I rolled my own Networking framework instead
- Data syncronization with server is currently broken
- Fun Challlenge. Appreciate the opportunity. ;)
